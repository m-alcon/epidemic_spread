\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Understanding how infectious diseases spread, has public health and ecological implications. The contact structure between hosts is known to have a key influence on disease spread. However, most studies assume that all types of contacts are identical, when in reality some individuals interact more strongly than others. This can be clearly seen in, for example, sexual-contact networks, where the number of sex acts is not equal for all partners. These differences between weights among partners, generates an heterogenous network and this heterogeneity can affect by speeding up or slowing down an epidemic spread depending on how strongly connected the hosts are.

In this project we are going to generate various networks that try to imitate the real world, changing the heterogeneity of the networks and seeing how two different infection models (SIR and SIS) spread on those. We replicate the simulation process done in the paper \cite{10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352}, where they generate different networks and simulate the SIR epidemics model with it. Furthermore, want to extend with the simulation of the SIS model.
