    abstract = {Author Summary Understanding how infectious diseases spread has public health and ecological implications. The contact structure between hosts strongly affects this spread. However, most studies assume that all types of contacts are identical, when in reality some individuals interact more strongly than others. This is particularly striking for sexual-contact networks, where the number of sex acts is not identical for all partnerships. This heterogeneity in activity can either speed up or slow down epidemic spread depending on how strongly the individuals' number of contacts coincides with their activity. There are two limitations to current frameworks that can explain the lack of studies on weighted networks. First, analytical results are difficult to obtain, which requires numerical simulations. Second, inferring weighted networks from survey data is extremely difficult. Here, we present a novel framework that allows to alleviate these two limitations. Building on configuration type network epidemic approaches, we manage to capture disease spread on weighted networks from the distribution of the number of contacts and distribution of the number of interaction events (e.g. sex acts). This allows us to derive analytical estimates for the epidemic threshold and the rate of spread of the disease. It also allows us to readily incorporate survey data, as illustrated in this study with data from the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (NATSAL) carried out in the UK.},
