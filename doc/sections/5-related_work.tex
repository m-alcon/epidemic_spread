\section{Related work}
As commented in section~\ref{sec:intro}, our work is based on \cite{10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352}. In this paper, the authors present a novel framework to estimate key epidemiological variables from joint probability distributions of $k$ and $l$. The framework also allows for a derivation of the full time course of epidemic prevalence and contact behavior, which are validated with simulations of the SIS epidemic spread on networks.



% We replicated the experiments that they made in the paper, which were only for SIR epidemics, and we extended them to SIS.
