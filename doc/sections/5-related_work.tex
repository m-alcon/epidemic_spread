\section{Related work}
As commented in section~\ref{sec:intro}, our work is based on \cite{10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003352}. In this paper, the authors present a novel framework to estimate key epidemiological variables from joint probability distributions of $k$ and $l$. The framework also allows for a derivation of the full time course of epidemic prevalence and contact behavior, which are validated with simulations of the SIR epidemic spread on networks. We replicated these simulations, using the same parameters to validate our results on SIR. With this, we extended their experiments to the SIS epidemics.
